# weather-app
Weather App created as an assignment for The Complete Node.js Developer Course 2 at Udemy.com
I learned how to setup a server with Node.js and Express framework and how to fetch data from REST APIs.

Weather App is running here at Heroku: https://aapro-weather-app.herokuapp.com/

Monthly usage is limited up to 250 searches.
